📌 About

This repository contains my daily Java practice programs.
I am currently learning basic concepts of Java and pushing my practice codes here to track my progress and improve step by step.

🛠️ Topics Covered (so far)

Printing patterns

Loops (for, while, do-while)

Conditional statements (if-else, switch)

Basic programs (sum, factorial, palindrome, etc.)

Arrays basics

🚀 Goal

Build a strong foundation in Java.

Upload daily practice programs.

Improve problem-solving and logical thinking.

Later, move towards _08__OOPs, Collections, File Handling, and Projects.
